            LANE. Say--where's the boss?

        MRS. BAUER. He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?

            [_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._

        LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
        groceries for Sawyers.

        MRS. BAUER. [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
        which hangs beside the door._] Here.

        LANE. What's the matter?

        MRS. BAUER. [_Dully._] Huh?

        LANE. [_Significantly._] Oh, I know.

        MRS. BAUER. What you know?

        LANE. About the boss. [MRS. BAUER _looks distressed_.] Heard your
        friends across the street talkin'.

        MRS. BAUER. [_Bitterly._] Friends!

        LANE. Rotten trick to play on the boss, all right, puttin' that old maid
        up to get him pinched.

        MRS. BAUER. [_Absently._] Was she an old maid?

        LANE. The cruelty-to-animals woman over there [_waves his
        hand_]--regular old crank. Nies[H] put her up to it all right.

        MRS. BAUER. I guess it was his old woman. Nies ain't so bad. She's the
        one. Because my two boys dress up a little on Sunday, she don't like it.

        LANE. Yes, she's sore because the boys told her the boss kicks their
        dog.
