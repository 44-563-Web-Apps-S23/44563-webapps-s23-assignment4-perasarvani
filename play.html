            <h6>LANE.</h6>Say--where's the boss?

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?

            [_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._

        LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
        groceries for Sawyers.

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>[_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
        which hangs beside the door._]</p><p> Here.</p>

        <h6>LANE.</h6><p> What's the matter?</p>

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>[_Dully._] Huh?</p>

        <h6>LANE.</h6> <p>[_Significantly._]</p><p> Oh, I know.</p>

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>What you know?</p>

        <h6>LANE.</h6><p> About the boss.</p><p> [MRS. BAUER _looks distressed_.] </p><p>Heard your
        friends across the street talkin'.</p>

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>[_Bitterly._] </p><P>Friends!</p>

        <h6>LANE.</h6><p>Rotten trick to play on the boss, all right, puttin' that old maid
        up to get him pinched.</p>

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6> <p>[_Absently._]</p><p> Was she an old maid?</p>

        <h6>LANE.</h6><p>The cruelty-to-animals woman over there</p><p> [_waves his
        hand_]</p><p>--regular old crank. Nies[H] put her up to it all right.</p>

        <h6>MRS. BAUER.</h6><p> I guess it was his old woman. Nies ain't so bad. She's the
        one. Because my two boys dress up a little on Sunday, she don't like it.</p>

        <h6>LANE.</h6><p>Yes, she's sore because the boys told her the boss kicks their
        dog.</p>
